# 🌌 STARSentinel: Space Systems Cybersecurity Toolkit

 📡 Overview

**STARSentinel** is a Python-based toolkit designed to simulate and detect vulnerabilities in space systems cybersecurity. It includes three core modules:

- 🛰 **GNSS Spoofing Detection**  
- 📡 **Satellite Communications Security Scanner**  
- 🚀 **Space Traffic Control Threat Simulator**

This project was developed as part of the **Digisuraksha Parhari Foundation Internship 2025** to showcase cybersecurity research and practical threat modeling in the domain of space-based systems.



 🔧 Features

 1. GNSS Spoofing Detection
- Parses GPS logs (NMEA format)
- Detects sudden jumps in position/time
- Flags spoofing behavior using signal consistency checks

 2. Satellite Comms Security Scanner
- Simulates scanning satellite IP/service range
- Analyzes TLE (Two-Line Element) data integrity
- Flags weak or exposed SatCom links

 3. Space Traffic Control Threat Simulator
- Uses NORAD TLE data to track satellite positions
- Simulates spoofed location inputs
- Detects near-collision scenarios due to fake data injection
