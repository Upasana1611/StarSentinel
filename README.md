# 🚀 STARSentinel

**STARSentinel** is a Python-based cybersecurity tool designed to protect space systems from emerging threats. It focuses on three critical domains: **GNSS Spoofing Detection**, **Satellite Communication (SatCom) Scanning**, and **Space Traffic Threat Simulation**. Developed for the **Digisuraksha Parhari Foundation Internship Program**, this project aims to bridge cybersecurity with the growing challenges of outer space technology.
