🛰️ Project Summary – StarSentinel: Space Systems Cybersecurity Toolkit
StarSentinel is a Python-based cybersecurity toolkit designed to simulate and detect threats in space systems, including satellite communication, GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems), and orbital traffic control. With space technology becoming a critical part of national infrastructure, this project addresses the rising need for space-focused cybersecurity tools and awareness.

Toolkit Includes:
🔍 GNSS Spoofing Detector – Detects fake or manipulated GPS signal logs.

📡 SatCom Security Scanner – Simulates scanning and identification of insecure satellite communication patterns.

🚦 Space Traffic Threat Simulator – Models cyber attack scenarios in orbital traffic control and collision avoidance systems.

The goal is to offer a hands-on educational platform for cybersecurity learners and researchers to explore real-world vulnerabilities in space technologies.
